# JS-Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a Rock Paper Scissors Game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user plays against the computer by selecting rock, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly generates its choice, and the game declares the result (win, lose, or draw). Scores are updated dynamically, with real-time feedback provided.

# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be interactive and fun, with real-time feedback and score tracking.

## How to Play

- Choose between **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** by clicking the corresponding icon.
- The computer will randomly generate its own choice.
- The result will be displayed as:
  - **Win** if your choice beats the computer's choice.
  - **Lose** if the computer's choice beats yours.
  - **Draw** if both choices are the same.
- Your score and the computer's score will be updated accordingly.

## Features

- User-friendly UI.
- Dynamic score updates.
- Feedback messages after each round (win, lose, or draw).
- Fully responsive design for mobile devices.
- Randomized computer choice for a fair game.
  
## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main structure of the game, containing the title, user interface, and scoreboards.
- `style.css`: CSS for styling the layout and making the design responsive.
- `script.js`: JavaScript for game logic and event handling.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:
1. How to use **event listeners** in JavaScript to capture user interactions.
2. The concept of **random number generation** to simulate the computer's choices.
3. How to implement **conditional logic** to determine the winner of each round.
4. How to dynamically update the **DOM** to reflect changes in the user interface (such as updating scores and messages).
5. How to make the game **responsive** so it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Future Improvements

- Add more game options like a "Best of 3" mode.
- Add animations for each round's result.
- Add a reset button to restart the game.
- Implement sound effects for a more interactive experience.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to start playing.
