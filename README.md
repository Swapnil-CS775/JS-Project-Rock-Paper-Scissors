# JS-Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a Rock Paper Scissors Game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user plays against the computer by selecting rock, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly generates its choice, and the game declares the result (win, lose, or draw). Scores are updated dynamically, with real-time feedback provided.
